    <h1>Privacy Policy for Code-Rhythm</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 30, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Code-Rhythm ("the App") handles
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Code-Rhythm is designed with your privacy in mind.
      <strong
        >This App does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal
        data from its users.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p>We do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name, email address, or any other identifying information.</li>
      <li>
        Device information (like IP address, device ID, or operating system
        details).
      </li>
      <li>
        Usage data (like app launch times, features used, or interactions).
      </li>
      <li>Location data.</li>
      <li>Any content you generate or interact with within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How the App Works</h2>
    <p>
      Code-Rhythm allows users to download publicly available source files from
      GitHub for the purpose of practicing typing against their text content.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GitHub Access:</strong> When you choose to download a file, the
        App connects directly to GitHub's public repositories to retrieve the
        selected content. This connection is solely for the purpose of
        downloading the requested file to your device. The App does not interact
        with your personal GitHub account (if you have one) or transmit any data
        to GitHub other than the request to download a specific public file.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. No Third-Party Services (for Data Collection)</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or
      data collection services that would collect user data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our App does not collect any personal data from anyone, including
      children. Therefore, we do not knowingly collect personal data from
      children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that
      their child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.
      As we do not collect any personal information, we would not have such data
      to remove.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
      changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted
      on this page.
    </p>
